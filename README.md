In this Jupyter notebook I will attempt to implement the Random Forest Algorithm on The Iris Flower Dataset using a Scikit-learn package in Python. The Iris Flower dataset comes with the Scikit-Learn package itself, meaning that it is clean enough to be used for training an ML model. This is useful for the scope of this project as it will allows me to explore the Scikit-learn package and focus on the nature of Random Forest Algorithm without spending time on obtaining, cleaning and transforming data.

    
**Objective:** To build a model that allows us to predict the type of an Iris flower based on its Petal and Sepal features such as length and width.
